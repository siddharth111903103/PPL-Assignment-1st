Solutions

1   Local variables are  suffixed with a unique  number which represents
    the assignment. For  example, `d_3' refers to the  usage of variable
    `d'  and  the  only  assignment  which reaches  this  point  is  the
    assignment `d_3'.  Variables that are  likely to be used  before any
    assignment are suffixed  with `(D)' to indicate  that the assignment
    was implicit in the declaration.  This happens to both uninitialized
    local variables and formal parameters.  For example, variable `c' is
    used as `c_4(D)' in the `if' condition.


2   A PHI node merges assignments from different paths and creates a new
    assignment. For example:

	# a_1 = PHI <a_5(3), a_7(4)> 

    indicates that if  the control reaches here from basic  block 3 then
    use the  value of a_5;  otherwise if  the control reaches  here from
    basic block 4 then use the value of a_7.


3   A switch statement can result in a merge of more than two paths (and
    hence possibly more than two assignments). Consider:

    int main()
    {
	int a, b;
	switch (a)
	{
	    case 1:
	        b = 2;
	        break;
	    case 2:
	        b = 3;
	        break;
	    case 3:
	        b = 4;
	    case 4:
	        b = 5;
	        break;
	    case 5:
	    case 6:
	        b = 6;
	        break;
	    default:
	        b = 7;
	}
	return b;
    }
    
    In this case  the PHI node at  the end of the  switch statement will
    merge multiple assignments such as:

    # b_1 = PHI <b_4(3), b_5(4), b_7(6), b_8(7), b_9(8)
